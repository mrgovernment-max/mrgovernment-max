# E-commerce Portfolio

This project is a personal **e-commerce portfolio** that demonstrates my web development skills. It features a simulated online store with product listings, a shopping cart, and a responsive design, all built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content and layout of the site, creating a semantic and accessible webpage.
- **CSS**: Styled the website using CSS, ensuring it is fully responsive with Flexbox and Grid layout systems for dynamic user experiences across different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented interactivity such as dynamic product filtering, shopping cart functionality, and page navigation.

## Features

- **Product Listings**: Displays a list of products with names, prices, and images.
- **Interactive Shopping Cart**: Users can add or remove items from the cart and view the updated total price in real time.
- **Responsive Design**: The website automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring it works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Product Search**: Allows users to filter products by categories or search terms.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrgovernment-max/e-commerce-portfolio.git
   
 **Navigate to the project directory:**
  cd e-commerce-portfolio
  open index.html

  **UASGE**
Browse the available products and filter them by category.
Add products to your cart and view the cart total in real time.
The site is responsive, so it will adjust its layout depending on the size of your screen.

**Future Improvements**
Backend Integration: Integrate with a backend system (e.g., Python with Flask or Django) to manage user sessions, product data, and cart functionality in a more dynamic way.
Payment Integration: Add a payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal to handle checkout and real purchases.
User Accounts: Implement user authentication to allow users to create accounts, log in, and track their orders.
Enhanced Product Search: Add advanced search filters such as sorting by price, rating, etc.
